# Conten_Analysis_Neural_Netork
Hi I am Dwi Setyo Aji from Indonesia.Currently I am doing my research on bachelor degree at UPN Veteran Jawa Timur Communication Science.
In this Project I will primarily using Artificial Intelligence especially Natural Language Processing with Tensorflow,Scikit-learn,Spacy,
gensim and a few other library like pandas,numpy,matplotlib,Networkx,plotly,pyvis and etc.Since I am from this major we are encountered
multiple text data. But In my university developing machine learning for analyse text is still new.

The first task I will complete is topic classification with Neural Network Architecture Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory<sup>[1]</sup>. The case will be in multiclass classification.
Company need to classify text so they can make more different approach for different problem. From digital humanites perspective this theory came from what we called Public Relation.
Building trusted relationship with public need a good understanding of the text data. Every text element of customer message need to clasify in perfect order
of scope.Let say a text complain will differently processed from a text contain customer complain.

Second Task will be sentiment analysis with Neural Network Architecture Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers<sup>[2]</sup>. The task only binary classification.This is because
for much easier to detect Public relation crisis.

Third task will be extract all text customer message using gensim in unsupervised latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)<sup>[3]</sup> model by gensim<sup>[4]</sup>. We are doing this to make us more understand
what happen or what topic people think about the research subject. With this machine learning we are can see a unseen pattern of message<sup>[5]</sup>.

 If there is a possible time I will also mapping the network graph<sup>[6]</sup>,in this scenario we can see who is the most powerfull person who have influence our sentiment in social media.
 For visualize the network we are gonna use networkx and pyvis<sup>[7]</sup>
